Sync your Ghostfolio with IBKR 
( more to come? Help is always welcome! )

## Setup

### IBKR
Follow this guide to configure your Flex Queries in your Interactive Brokers account:

https://help.wealthica.com/help/how-to-connect-ib-interactive-brokers-and-configure-the-flex-report

When you configure your Flex Query give it: **Cash report** and **Cash transactions**, leaving all options disabled for both.

**Important: If you dont want ghostfolio-sync to sync everything everytime and make it quicker, just set a shorter window for the query. Keep in mind that what was not synced by ghostfolio-sync in that period of time will be lost (ie when the window moves and content was not uploaded to ghostfolio). This can be avoided at the cost of a longer window of time and longer sync**

### Ghostfolio
* Take note of your user **KEY** (generated upon user creation and used to login to Ghostfolio)
* Run the following on the terminal (replace `ghostfol.io` with `localhost` or your host url if you are self-hosting):

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{ "accessToken": "YOUR-USER-KEY-GOES-HERE }' \    
	https://ghostfol.io/api/v1/auth/anonymous
```

* Take note of the token `{"authToken":"12cd45...`. That is your **GHOST_TOKEN**

## Run in Docker

```docker run -e GHOST_TOKEN=YOUR_GHOST_TOKEN -e IBKR_TOKEN=YOUR-IBKR-TOKEN -e IBKR_QUERY=YOUR-IBKR-QUERY agusalex/ghostfolio-sync```
